### Compiling
To compile the source, simply run `make` within this directory. This will build the LibFS library, as well as several test programs you can use to experiment with file systems.

This program was built on and compiles for **Linux**; it is NOT cross-platform and will most likely NOT work on Windows.

### Testing
The sample programs allow you to experiment with LibFS. `simple-ui.exe` opens up a convenient interface to run several different operations and manipulate files in the file system, while programs like `slow-touch.exe`, `slow-cat.exe`, and `slow-mkdir.exe` allow you to experiment with atomic operations equivalent to their usual commands (`touch`, `cat`, and `mkdir`, respectively).

The default disk image file for most of the programs is `default-disk`, but most sample programs will also accept a custom disk image name and automatically create a file system with that name.
